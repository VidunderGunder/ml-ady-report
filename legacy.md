## About ‚ÑπÔ∏è

ML-Ady aims to make an approachable way to utilize machine learning for the betterment of humanity, by using cutting edge techniques and a no frills attitude.

Downscaled RC farm and construction vehicles are made to handle any task on any budget. They are mass produced and downscaled version of established industrial solutions, so development is cut to a minimum.

There sadly is no teeny-tiny workforce to accompany them - but that can be solved using modern artificial intelligence.

Virtually all safety concerns related to autonomous vehicles are irrelevant, as RC vehicles can hardly scratch children or even small animals if a crash or an accident should occur.

ML-Ady's long-term vision is to be an AI- and robotics foundation intended for a wide variety of use-cases, but initially the goal will be to create a fleet of budget RC vehicles to collect garbage at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences and surrounding areas.
