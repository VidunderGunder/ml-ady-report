# MLAdy - Autonomous Robots for Everyone <!-- omit in toc -->

Safe, budget-oriented and scalable re-purposing of consumer grade electronics for public goods and industrial applications with reinforcement learning.

...or in plain English for non-robots:

---

**Make toys do work.**

MLAdy aims to make an approachable way to utilize artificial intelligence (AI) for the betterment of humanity, by using cutting edge technology and a no frills attitude.

Most robotics firms develop expensive and custom-made robots entirely from scratch, and as a result adoption of the technology suffers. The main challenge in combining AI and robotics is not the machinery, but the digital brain that operates it. That's why MLAdy exists - to develop a framework that allows for quick, cheap and accessible realization of autonomous robots.

Downscaled RC farm and construction vehicles are made to handle any task on any budget. They are mass produced and downscaled version of established industrial solutions, so development is cut to a minimum. As a bonus, they are lot safer to develop and deploy than heavy machinery. There sadly is no teeny-tiny workforce to accompany them - MLAdy solves that problem with modern artificial intelligence.

MLAdy's long-term vision is to be an AI- and robotics foundation intended for a wide variety of use-cases. To realize this, a clear and concise goal is needed. Optimally something that attracts developers, students and investors to the project.

The environmental challenges of this day and age is as relevant as ever, and garbage is piling up. Hence, the initial prototype will be the deployment of a fleet of budget RC vehicles, to collect garbage at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU) and surrounding areas.

The final product will be an open hub for end-to-end AI and robotics, consisting of code, tools and methods for real-world application. It will be digitally hosted as open source repositories and resources on the web, accompanied by a network of mentors at NMBU's student innovation center Eik Lab.

## Research and Innovation



### Research and/or Knowledge

The core team is made up of engineering students and tech enthusiasts at NMBU, engaged in disciplines ranging from mechanical and electrical engineering to application development and data science. All members are active and pioneering participants of a student organization by the name Eik Lab, who recently became an official part of NMBU. It is the University's hub of innovation, with a long track-record of pioneering and bleeding edge technology projects.

The core teams prior experience include:

- Digitization of industrial documentation
- Research equipment for gene manipulation (CRISPR)
- Detection of mice species with machine learning
- Smart water fountains
- Full stack web development

### Level of Innovation

The industry seems stuck on creating expensive and tailored solutions for giant corporations and educational institutions, and most of the innovation is closed source. MLAdy aims to change this, by offering an open platform. 

An open platform will reduce friction associated with development, as all licenses will be free to use until it is applied in a commercial setting, and allow for rapid prototyping for its users. An open platform will give MLAdy an edge over closed source competition by gaining valuable feedback and improvements from the community, which is especially valuable for data-hungry reinforcement learning, while boosting innovation and adoption of autonomous robots by making it budget friendly and easy to use.

As commercial application of the technology is virtually limitless, the threat of competition is limited, and MLAdy will most likely reap more benefits of an open community.

In the long run, applications can include (but are not limited to):

- Construction
- Storage
- Farming
- Logistics
- Search and resources
- Industrial production
- Education

Deployment will be faster than other methods, as the core idea is retrofitting tried-and-true vehicles and machinery already in use, bypassing a large amount of development needed for custom-tailored hardware solutions.

The barrier to entry for AI and robotics is high, being expensive and complex, so reducing this to a level that allows for limited prototype implementations may be an effective way of facilitating commercial use. MLAdy hopes to reduce the difficulty of a real life implementation to a level suited for a small team of engineering students. This would provide high-skilled jobs for students before examination and substantial tech-based economic growth.

MLAdy can gain a valuable network assisting the students in this process by acting as mentors, given that projects are successfully implemented and commercial actors are satisfied with the initiative.

## Impacts and Outcomes

The idea was born out of a discussion regarding automation of forklifts at a factory where part of the core team does software development in 2019. Some recent advancements has showed it possible to implement a framework for quick prototyping, enabling implementation in a wide variety of areas.

### Market Insight and Areas of Application

As mentioned previously, conventional areas of utilizing machinery are likely first candidates for early implementation. MLAdy will propose low-risk test projects to potential clients in agriculture, construction, storage and so on, assigning aspiring students (or other fiery souls) to do the implementation. The core team will primarily develop the framework, while guiding and keeping close contact with implementing participants, who will gather valuable real-world data and experience that can feed back to the framework, but are free to join an implementation hands-on.

This method enables dynamic discovery of the most suited clientele to further pursue and focus effort on, offers a huge potential for learning and warms up firms to the idea of applied autonomous robotics.

#### Competition

There are multiple big actors working on robotics:

- Boston Dynamics
- ANYbotics
- SIASUN
- Clearpath robotics
- Fetch robotics
- Amazon robotics
- Sarcos
- Diligent Robotics
- [Universal Robots](https://www.universal-robots.com/)

Most if not all have started to adopt modern AI.

NVIDIA is working on an end-to-end software suite for robotics with AI-support, by the name Isaac.

The common factor for all the aforementioned corporations are,

### Realization strategy

Each successful implementation using the framework gives an opportunity to start a venture with the client in question. As each client and student group will have unique preferences regarding a development and implementation pipeline, MLAdy would allow students to be hired directly by the client, do further work freelance or start their own consultation firms. The core team is welcome to do the same.

Making MLAdy a private firm would go against its principles and goals. It is better suited as a hub for democratic robotics and AI development, serving a multitude of ventures, all cooperating if they so wish.

### Conditions and Rights

By not commercializing MLAdy directly, new users are free to use educational licenses and free tiers, making learning and development more accessible. Licenses and tiers needed will then be decided for a limited scope for test projects on a per project basis, and readdressed if the project develops to something more permanent.

### Benefit to Society and Sustainability
